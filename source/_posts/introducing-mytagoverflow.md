myTagOverflow is a free web app generating a data visualization to show the tags on which you are most active on stackOverflow.

TL;DR: [Try it](https://mango-is.com/tools/myTagOverflow/), you're three clicks away from getting your own graph ;)

## Story

As I was updating my website's home page a few weeks ago, I though about using factual data to demonstrate my technical abilities, rather than just telling about them.

I investigated possible data sources. Had a look at [gitHub](https://github.com/) first, which I am using for a most of the development work, and project management. It turned out that their API would not be very convenient to pull the information I was interested in.

Then I had a look at [stackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), the leading developers forum. I'm active in there from time to time, as some questions present interesting challenges and are good exercises. Their API makes it easy to get the top tags (technologies / concepts) on which a user is active, and there is also an endPoint which can be used to determine the number of questions common for two given tags.

This is great, because this lets us build a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)), hence use cool graph processing algorithms (#dataScienceRocks ðŸ‘Œ ).

Fast forward a days of work, and here is a good-looking enough implementation in place.

## How to use

It's pretty straightforward to use:

1. Clicks on "Login" to give access to your stackExchange account. Your graph is generated
2. Complete the legend by giving a meaningful name to each tags group.
3. (optional) Drag-and-drop the tags if you'd like to adjust the layout.
4. Click on the Export button to save the graph in an SVG file.


## Try it yourself and contribute

Get your own graph <a href="https://mango-is.com/tools/myTagOverflow/">here</a> .

This is a first implementation, extra features could be added:
* get data from other stackExchange sites
* Support export as a png image, in addition to SVG.
* show progress of the data extraction

We're open to contributions from other developers. If you'd like to enhance myTagOverflow, [get in touch](https://github.com/Mango-information-systems/mango-is-website/labels/myTagOverflow) ;)

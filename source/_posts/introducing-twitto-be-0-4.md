We have just released a major upgrade of [twitto.be](http://twitto.be) which introduces the following improvements:

* multi-dimensional filtering: you can now combine filters on topic, location and language.
* new influence ratings: we now use Klout as the influence score rather than Kred.
* updated categorization system.

The aim of this new version is to improve the user experience and let visitors browse the twittos using powerful filters, while providing statistics on the population. Kudos to [Panos](http://gr.linkedin.com/in/psynetos) who did most of the web development on twitto.

## New features

### Powerful filters

We've introduced three charts shown at the side of the page. They **display statistics** about the data you are looking at and **act as filters**. Each bar on the bar charts, and the provinces in the map are clickable and trigger filters that update the current page.

Used together, we can get some interesting insights from them, notably the prevalence of dutch-speaking twittos.


### Klout scores and ranks

[Klout](http://klout.com) is a pioneer in measuring of social media influence. The concept is controversial, and accuracy of such scores is relative. We started twitto using [Kred](http://kred.com) as it provides a twitter-only breakdown of the social influence, whereas Klout may take activity of other social media (Google+, linkedIn, ...) into account for some users.

But, Kred is not perfect either though. It seems to provide high scores very easily. While this may be flattering for some people, this makes it difficult to identify actual influencers. On the technical side, we also had performance and reliability issues with Kred which mean that it was difficult to keep your scores up-to-date.

For those interested, we'll publish a series of posts comparing the social media influence measuring systems in future, stay tuned.

### Topics

The 5 previous categories have been replaced with 9 categories, some of them quite generic (entertainment, business), some other more niche (design, health). This let's us categorize new people more easily.
